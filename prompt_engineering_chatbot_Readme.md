Prompt Engineering Chatbot
A conversational AI demonstrating advanced prompt engineering techniques.
This project showcases the creation of a simple, yet intelligent, chatbot built using the OpenAI API and advanced prompt engineering. The core goal of this project was to explore how subtle changes in a system prompt can dramatically improve the chatbot's ability to provide accurate, creative, and persona-driven responses.

The chatbot is designed to act as a witty historical guide, providing information on ancient history with a touch of dry humor.

🧠 Prompt Engineering in Action
The secret behind this chatbot's personality is the carefully crafted system prompt. By instructing the model to "act as a witty historian" and "never break character," we guide its responses to be both informative and engaging. This highlights the power of prompt engineering in shaping AI behavior beyond simple question-and-answer interactions.
